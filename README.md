## ✨ Features

- **YouTube Video Analysis**: Automatically extracts and processes transcripts from any YouTube video
- **AI-Powered Q&A**: Ask questions about video content and get accurate, context-aware answers
- **Interactive UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with real-time responses
- **Export Functionality**: Save your conversations for later reference
- **Suggested Questions**: Get started quickly with pre-defined question suggestions

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- Streamlit (For UI)
- Ollama (with Mistral 7B model installed and nomic-embed-text for embeddings)
- youtube-transcript-api library for transcript extraction
- LangChain framework for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RazaMasood/AskMyVideo.git
   cd askmyvideo
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 📋 How to Use

1. **Load a Video**: Paste a YouTube URL in the sidebar input field
2. **Process Video**: Click "Process Video" to extract and analyze the content
3. **Ask Questions**: Type your questions about the video in the main chat area
4. **Review Answers**: Get AI-generated responses based on the video content
5. **Export Conversation**: Download your Q&A session for future reference

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Transcript Extraction**: The app extracts the transcript from the provided YouTube video
2. **Text Processing**: The transcript is processed and embedded using Nomic for semantic search
3. **RAG Pipeline**: Uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach to find relevant sections of the transcript
4. **Ollama Integration**: Sends context and queries to locally-hosted Mistral 7B model via Ollama
5. **Response Generation**: Delivers accurate answers based on the retrieved context
